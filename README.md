THE NORM
The norm rules are a set of guidelines similar to SOLID principles. These rules help make our projects more organized and readable. At Ecole 42, even a single norm violation can result in the project receiving a failing grade.



PEER TO PEER EVALUATION
When we complete a project, we need to get it approved by three of our peers who will evaluate it at different times. During this process, they ask us questions to ensure that we have done the project ourselves. During the evaluation, each function we used in the project and how these functions work behind the scenes are asked about individually. While our program runs and when it terminates, the evaluator checks if there are any memory leaks. The evaluator also checks if our project adheres to the norm rules.
When evaluating our project, the reviewer follows the guidelines on the evaluation page and tests our project manually or with automated testing tools. If our program crashes for any reason, we fail the project and must retry it later.
At the end of the evaluation, our peer writes a comment for us. This comment may include our shortcomings, aspects of the project they liked and disliked, and any recommendations they might have. Additionally, our peer gives a score for each section they evaluated.



Introduction to 42 Moulinette

The 42 Moulinette is an automated grading tool used at Ecole 42 to evaluate student projects. This powerful tool is designed to ensure that all submissions meet the school's rigorous standards. Here's an overview of its key features and benefits:

  Automated Testing: The Moulinette runs a series of predefined tests on your code to check for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to project specifications. It ensures that your program behaves as expected under various conditions.

  Norm Compliance: The Moulinette verifies that your code follows the Ecole 42 norm rules, which are akin to modern SOLID principles. These rules help make your code more readable, maintainable, and efficient. A single norm violation can result in a failing grade, emphasizing the importance of clean coding practices.

  Memory Leak Detection: During the evaluation, the Moulinette checks for memory leaks and other potential issues that could affect the stability and performance of your program. Ensuring that your code is free of leaks is crucial for creating reliable and efficient software.

  Comprehensive Feedback: After running its tests, the Moulinette provides detailed feedback on your submission. This includes information on any errors or issues detected, as well as suggestions for improvement. This feedback is invaluable for learning and improving your coding skills.

  Peer Reviews: In addition to automated testing, the Moulinette integrates peer review processes. Your peers can provide additional insights, comments, and scores based on their evaluations, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of your work.

  EXAM SYSTEM
  
  Ecole 42's exam system is very strict. Exams are conducted in a designated exam area on special exam computers. These computers have no internet connection and have minimal software installed; even basic extensions for VSCode, like C extensions, are not available. During the exam, a system called examshell provides a random question based on the difficulty level, which we must solve. After writing our solution, it is tested by an AI called grademe, which is similar to Moulinette but even stricter. To progress through each level, we must pass these exams.

  Consistency and Fairness: The Moulinette ensures a consistent and fair evaluation process for all students. By automating much of the grading process, it eliminates biases and human errors, providing an objective assessment of each project.


DOCTOR CHECK
Within 42, there are officials responsible for monitoring our projects. These individuals randomly review previously completed projects to assess our understanding. They open these projects and ask us to explain them. Based on their evaluation, they write a report on our performance. If we fail to demonstrate the required competence, we face severe penalties.
