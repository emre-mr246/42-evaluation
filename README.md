### **THE NORM**
The norm rules at Ecole 42 are a set of guidelines akin to the SOLID principles in software development. These rules are designed to enhance the organization, readability, and maintainability of our projects. They serve as a framework for students to cultivate disciplined coding practices and foster professional-level software craftsmanship.

Adherence to these norms is paramount as even a single violation can lead to the project being deemed unacceptable, potentially resulting in a failing grade. This stringent adherence underscores the importance of clean, structured code that not only meets functional requirements but also adheres to best practices in software engineering.

By following the norm rules, students not only ensure their projects meet academic standards but also prepare themselves for real-world software development scenarios where clean, maintainable code is essential for long-term success.

### **PEER TO PEER EVALUATION**
When we complete a project, we need to get it approved by three of our peers who will evaluate it at different times. During this process, they ask us questions to ensure that we have done the project ourselves. During the evaluation, each function we used in the project and how these functions work behind the scenes are asked about individually. While our program runs and when it terminates, the evaluator checks if there are any memory leaks. The evaluator also checks if our project adheres to the norm rules.
When evaluating our project, the reviewer follows the guidelines on the evaluation page and tests our project manually or with automated testing tools. If our program crashes for any reason, we fail the project and must retry it later.
At the end of the evaluation, our peer writes a comment for us. This comment may include our shortcomings, aspects of the project they liked and disliked, and any recommendations they might have. Additionally, our peer gives a score for each section they evaluated.

### **MOULINETTE "THE GRINDER"**
The 42 Moulinette is an automated grading tool used at Ecole 42 to evaluate student projects. This powerful tool is designed to ensure that all submissions meet the school's rigorous standards. Here's an overview of its key features and benefits:

1. Automated Testing: The Moulinette runs a series of predefined tests on your code to check for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to project specifications. It ensures that your program behaves as expected under various conditions.
2. Norm Compliance: The Moulinette verifies that your code follows the Ecole 42 norm rules, which are akin to modern SOLID principles. These rules help make your code more readable, maintainable, and efficient. A single norm violation can result in a failing grade, emphasizing the importance of clean coding practices.
 3. Memory Leak Detection: During the evaluation, the Moulinette checks for memory leaks and other potential issues that could affect the stability and performance of your program. Ensuring that your code is free of leaks is crucial for creating reliable and efficient software.
  4. Comprehensive Feedback: After running its tests, the Moulinette provides detailed feedback on your submission. This includes information on any errors or issues detected, as well as suggestions for improvement. This feedback is invaluable for learning and improving your coding skills.
  5. Peer Reviews: In addition to automated testing, the Moulinette integrates peer review processes. Your peers can provide additional insights, comments, and scores based on their evaluations, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of your work.

### **EXAM SYSTEM**
Ecole 42 Exam System

Ecole 42 employs a rigorous exam system designed to ensure fairness and uphold high standards of assessment.
Exam Environment

Exams take place in designated areas using specialized exam computers. These computers are isolated from the internet and have minimal software installed, ensuring a controlled testing environment. For instance, even basic extensions for editors like VSCode, including C extensions, are not available during exams. This restriction aims to maintain the integrity and security of the testing process.
Examshell and Question Format

During the exam, a system called examshell presents a random question tailored to the difficulty level of the exam. Students are required to solve this question within a specified timeframe, demonstrating their understanding and problem-solving skills in real-time.
Evaluation by grademe

Once students complete their solutions, they are evaluated by an AI system known as grademe. Similar to Moulinette but stricter in its assessments, grademe thoroughly tests the correctness, efficiency, and adherence to specifications of each solution. This automated evaluation ensures consistency and objectivity in grading across all exam submissions.
Progression and Requirements

To advance through each level of their studies at Ecole 42, students must successfully pass these rigorous exams. This process not only assesses their technical proficiency but also prepares them for the challenges of professional software development, where precision and adherence to standards are critical.
Conclusion

The stringent exam system at Ecole 42 underscores its commitment to academic excellence and prepares students for real-world applications of their skills. By navigating these challenges, students develop resilience, problem-solving abilities, and a deep understanding of software engineering principles.

### **STAFF CHECK**
Within 42, there are officials responsible for monitoring our projects. These individuals randomly review previously completed projects to assess our understanding. They open these projects and ask us to explain them. Based on their evaluation, they write a report on our performance. If we fail to demonstrate the required competence, we face severe penalties.
